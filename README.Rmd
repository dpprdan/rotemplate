rotemplate provides a custom pkgdown template for rOpenSci packages. Please don’t use it for your own package if it's not an rOpenSci package (i.e. listed on https://ropensci.org/packages/).

Inspired by [tidytemplate](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidytemplate/) and [lockedatapkg](https://github.com/lockedatapublished/lockedatapkg).

* [`ropenaq`](https://ropensci.github.io/ropenaq/)
