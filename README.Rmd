rotemplate provides a custom pkgdown template for rOpenSci packages. Please don’t use it for your own package if it's not an rOpenSci package (i.e. only use it for packages listed on https://ropensci.org/packages/).

Inspired by [tidytemplate](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidytemplate/) and [lockedatapkg](https://github.com/lockedatapublished/lockedatapkg).

## How to use `rotemplate`

### If your website has no `pkgdown` website yet

Run

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```

And to ensure your website will be automatically deployed from Travis, which we recommend,

```r
usethis::use_pkgdown_travis()
```

Note that the setup that'll be recommended by running the function above consists in updating the website on a gh-pages branch with every push, which 
might bloat your git history. If you want to avoid that, have a look at

* the [setup in `magick` repo](https://github.com/ropensci/magick/blob/e8895c35df8a985212cc5b094a2aaad7389d029d/.travis.yml#L14): the website is only built when there's a GitHub release, which uses the following code in its `.travis.yml` file.

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: Rscript -e 'pkgdown::deploy_site_github()'
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
```

* The [Travis-free, Makefile-based setup in `cyphr` repo](https://github.com/ropensci/cyphr). The gh-pages branch is created anew each time the website is updated. The website is built locally.

### In all cases

#### Tweak `_pkgdown.yml` config

In your `_pkgdown.yml` config file make sure to add the following lines

```yaml
template:
  package: rotemplate
```

#### Tweak the `.travis.yml` config

To `.travis.yml` add a command installing the package template, i.e. something like

```yaml
before_cache: 
  Rscript -e 'remotes::install_cran("pkgdown");remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/rotemplate").'
```

Locally, if you want to build and preview the website, you'll need to ensure that `rotemplate` is installed, and then build your website:

```r
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/rotemplate")
pkgdown::build_site()
```

#### Make sure the website has a favicon

If your package has no logo of its own, use the rOpenSci hex by running the code below, but do not necessarily put it in the README as mentioned by `usethis` (your choice). This way the package website will have a favicon.

```r
usethis::use_logo("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/logos/master/stickers/blue_short_hexsticker.png")
# but do not necessarily put it in the README as mentioned by `usethis`,
# your call!
pkgdown::build_favicon()
```
